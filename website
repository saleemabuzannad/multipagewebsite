    <p>How to Play Volleyball</p>
<ul>
  <li>A volleyball game consists of two teams of six players each, separated by a net. The six volleyball court positions are setter, middle blocker, outside hitter, opposite hitter, libero and serving specialist.

</li>
  <li>Then the two teams will rally—or hit the ball back and forth over the net—until a fault occurs. There is a maximum of three hits per side.

</li>
  <li>Three-set matches are two sets to 25 points and a third set to 15 points. Each set must be won by two points. The first team to win two sets is the winner of the match.</li>
</ul>
